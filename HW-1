Part B (Short Answer)
6. A software process is the set of tasks that you do to fulfill the software life cycle to develop a good quality product. The software life cycle (SDLC) describes the entire timeline of the software product like design, implementation, testing, maintenance etc. 
7. Software engineering is like engineering because it uses organized steps and rules to build programs. It's also creative since people have to come up with their own ideas and designs for solving problems. Critical decision making plays a huge role because you have to choose what works best considering time, cost, and users. 
8. Plan driven methodologies like Waterfall are following a set of plan step by step, but means you can't change things later. Agile is more flexible because you can change and improve as you go but it's harder to get a good picture of the final product from the beginning. 
9. Quality assurance makes sure the software is working right and does what the user wants it to do. Verfication means making sure the product is being built and design right and validation means that the product is working well and fulfills user needs. Two examples of validation are user testing, the user tries the software and sees if it meets their needs and the other one is system testing which is when the entire system is tested to make sure it's working as planned. 
10. One main reason why modern software engineering is more challenging than traditional engineering is because modern engineering is always changing based on user needs and requirments wehreas traditional engineering has always has fixed requirments which makes it easier to come up with a plan and follow through.
